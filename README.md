 ## Description
  
This application is a command line README generator that takes a user's response to questions and reformatted into a markdown file to be used as a README. It uses NVM, NPM, and Inquirer v8.2.4.
  
- What was our motivation?
  
The main motivation for this project was to save users time on the tedious task of writing a README markdown from scratch.
  
- What problem does it solve?
  
This application was made with the intention of saving programmers time so they have more freedom to work on other cool projects!
  
- What did we learn?
  
One major lesson learned from building this project is, when acquiring data from a user through questions to make sure to ask relevant, pointed questions that encourage a direct, detailed answer. After all, a README should be as informative as possible!
  
- What makes our app different from others?
  
This project shares many similarities with other apps of it's kind. However, users will appreciate the simplicity and ease of using this app versus others.
  
- Some challenges we faced were:
  
As stated earlier in this README, one big challenge was devising appropriate questions to ask the user so that their README will be as thorough as possible. Another challenge was getting the markdown to render correctly in the generateMarkdown.js file. There was a hiccup somewhere between the renderLicense functions and the actual generate markdown function. The solution was as simple as double checking the names of variables to make sure everything was congruent.
  
## Installation
  
FIrst, navigate to the GitHub repository here --> Then, run ```npm install```. Next, run the application ```npm run start```. You will be presented with a series of questions in the command line where you may type each response into the terminal and press enter to submit each answer.
  
## Usage
  
Once the application is cloned and dependencies are installed, simply run ```npm run start``` from the project directory and answer the questions in the command line. The application will do the rest!
